# List Counter
This mod shows how many lists a level appears in (rated lists).
This mod is for list/diamond grinders or other people like me who are just curious lol.
## Coming soon (I already have an API set up for this; I just don't have the motivation to implement it)
- Best levels: a page with levels that are in the most lists (if you're curious, go to https://ihaveawebsiteidea.com — don't mind the domain name; I don't have money to buy a GD-related one)
- Unrated lists option
### Go grind these list levels, champion <3
#### if you really want to use my api go ahead but it ~~might~~ will be slow
