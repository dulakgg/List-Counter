# List Counter
This mod shows how many lists a level appears in (rated lists).
This mod is for list/diamond grinders or other people like me who are just curious lol.
## Coming soon (I already have an API set up for this; I just don't have the motivation to implement it)
- Best levels: a page with levels that are in the most lists (if you're curious, go to https://ihaveawebsiteidea.com — don't mind the domain name; I don't have money to buy a GD-related one)
- Unrated lists option
- Lists in which the level appears in this popup
### Go grind these list levels, champion <3
i will be so mad if this mod was already made and i never noticed
